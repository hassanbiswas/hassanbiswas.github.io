🛠️ Best Practice Suggestions for Your Meta Tags
Rather than a list of keywords for the deprecated meta keywords tag, here's how you should use keywords in the modern, effective SEO meta tags:
1. Page Title Tag (\le 60 Characters)
This is the most critical tag. Include your primary keyword, your name/brand, and a strong value proposition.
> Web Developer | Responsive Website Design & Front-End Development
> 
2. Meta Description Tag (\le 160 Characters)
This snippet appears under your title in search results and acts as an ad for your page. It should be compelling and include your primary keywords.
> Freelance Front-End Developer, Hassan Biswas, specializing in modern, mobile-ready, and SEO-friendly custom website design. Let's build your professional online brand.
> 
3. Personal & Contact Keywords (Avoid in Meta Tags)
Keywords for your name, phone number, and email address (e.g., hassanbiswas.github.io@gmail.com, +8801602873384, mdezazulhassanbiswas) are not effective SEO keywords for attracting clients.
 * Correction: Keep these visible on your Contact page, Footer, and in your CV/Resume. Search engines will naturally associate these details with your website from the body content (and structured data, if you use it).
 * Do NOT include them in your Meta Description or Page Title, as they are not what a potential client is searching for initially.
