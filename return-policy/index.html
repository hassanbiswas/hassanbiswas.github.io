  Web Developer | Hassan Biswas - Return and Refund Policy

We offer a hassle-free return policy to ensure you are satisfied with your purchase. If you are not completely happy with your item, you can return it within the timeframe and conditions outlined below.

**1. Return Timeframe**

You have **14 days** from the date you receive your order to initiate a return or exchange.

**2. Condition of Items**

To be eligible for a return, your item must be:
*   Unused and in the same condition that you received it.
*   In its original packaging with all tags and labels attached.
*   Accompanied by a receipt or proof of purchase (order number is sufficient).

Returns will not be accepted if the product is damaged, used, or returned more than 14 days after delivery.

**3. Non-Returnable Items**

Certain items cannot be returned, including:
*   Perishable goods (e.g., food, flowers).
*   Personalized or custom-made products.
*   Health and personal care items, or products unsealed after delivery for hygiene reasons (e.g., underwear, some cosmetics).
*   Gift cards.

4.  Package the item securely and send it back to us using the provided label.

**5. Return Shipping Costs**

*   **We cover return shipping costs** if the return is a result of our error (e.g., damaged or defective item, wrong product received).
*   For returns due to other reasons (e.g., change of mind, incorrect size/color), **the customer is responsible for the return shipping costs**.

**6. Refunds and Processing Time**

Once your return is received and inspected, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
